# Code-Branch-Prediction
C++ has "likely" and "unlikely" attributes attached to if-else branches. They help the compiler optimize toward the most commonly taken branch. We leverage an LLM to predict the labeling of these "likely" or "unlikely" labels automatically.

## Getting Started
1. Install dataset 
2. Follow along with notebook in an environment with proper GPU (ex. Google Colab's A100)
