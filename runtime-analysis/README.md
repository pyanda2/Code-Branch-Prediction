### Directories ###
- unlabeled: contains all the unlabeled files to compare against 
- generated: contains all the files generated by the model   
### Evaluation Metrics ###
- evalution.py: usage ```python3 evaluation/evaluation.py```. Runs and times all projects in the groundtruth and generated directories. 
    - Assumes the existence of Makefile with `exec` and `clean` targets. Also assumes that the project compiles to a `./bin/` directory with executable named `exec`
